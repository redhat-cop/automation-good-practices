= Collections good practices

=== Collection Structure should be at the type or landscape level
[%collapsible]
====
Explanations:: Collections should be comprised of roles collected either at the type or landscape level. See <<structures/README.adoc#_define_which_structure_to_use_for_which_purpose,The Structures Definition>>

Rationale:: Gathering and publishing collections, rather than individual roles, allows for easier distribution and particularly becomes more important when we discuss Execution Environments.

=== Create implicit collection variables and reference them in your roles' defaults variables
[%collapsible]
====
Explanations:: Often, variables will want to be defined on a collection level, but this can cause issues with roles being able to be reused.
By defining collection wide variables and referencing them in roles' defaults variables, this can be made clear and roles can remain reusable.
Collection variables are nowhere defined explicitly and are to be documented in the collection's documentation.

Rationale:: Variables that are shared across collections can cause collisions when roles are reused outside of the original collection.
Role variables should continue to be named according to our <<roles/README.adoc#naming-things,recommendations for naming variables>>
It still remains possible to overwrite collection variable values for a specific role.
Each role has it's own set of defaults for the variable.

Examples::
For a collection "mycollection", two roles exist. "alpha" and "beta".  For this example, there is no default for the controller_username
and would have to be defined in one's inventory. The no_log variable does have defaults defined, and thus only needs to be defined if the default
is being overwritten.

.Alpha defaults/main.yml
[source,yaml]
----
# specific role variables
alpha_job_name: 'some text'
# collection wide variables
alpha_controller_username: "{{ mycollection_controller_username }}"
alpha_no_log: "{{ mycollection_no_log | default('true') }}"
----
+
.Beta defaults/main.yml
[source,yaml]
----
# specific role variables
beta_job_name: 'some other text'
# collection wide variables
beta_controller_username: "{{ mycollection_controller_username }}"
beta_no_log: "{{ mycollection_no_log | default('false') }}"
