Explanations:: Collections should be comprised of roles collected either at the type or landscape level. See https://github.com/redhat-cop/automation-good-practices/blob/main/structures/README.adoc[the structures definition]

Rationale:: Gathering and publishing collections, rather than individual roles, allows for easier distribution and particularly becomes more important when we discuss Execution Environments.

[%collapsible]
====
Explanations:: Collections should always be imported using requirements files within the role

Rationale:: Prior art, https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2020/ansible-best-practices-using-project-local-collections-and-roles
