= Playbooks good practices

== Keep your playbooks as simple as possible
[%collapsible]
====
Explanations:: Don't put too much logic in your playbook, put it in your roles (or even in custom modules), and try to limit your playbooks to a list of a roles.

Rationale:: Roles are meant to be re-used and the structure helps you to make your code re-usable.
The more code you put in roles, the higher the chances you, or others, can reuse it.
Also, if you follow the <<structures/README.adoc#_define_which_structure_to_use_for_which_purpose,type-function pattern>>, you can very easily create new (type) playbooks by just re-shuffling the roles.
This way you can create a playbook for each purpose without having to duplicate a lot of code.
This, in turn, also helps with the maintainability as there is only a single place where necessary changes need to be implemented, and that is in the role

Examples::
+
.An example of playbook containing only roles
[source,yaml]
----
---
- name: A playbook can solely be a list of roles
  hosts: all
  gather_facts: false
  become: false
  roles:
    - role1
    - role2
    - role3
----
+
TIP: we'll explain later why there might be a case for using `include_role`/`import_role` tasks instead of the role section.
====

== Use play argspec validation early in plays
[%collapsible]
====
Explanations:: Play arguments should have metadata and type validation, similar to role arguments.

Rationale:: Validating play arguments against an argspec helps catch argument issues quickly. 
Rather than waiting until a task fails from improperly defined arguments, playbooks should have an initial task checking args for requirements. 
The argspec file can also add details about usage, authorship, and give examples.

Examples::
+
.An example of a play argspec file
[source,yaml]
----
---
short_description: A shorter summary of `description` below
description: This is a description of a playbook, that may contain multiple plays with multiple play argument specs
argument_specs:
  debug_localhost: # Name of the play
    short_description: Play for printing a debug message
    description:
      - Example play within a collection containing an argspec for printing a debug message
    author:
      - developer (@developer)
    options:
      message:
        description: Debug message to print
        type: str
        required: true
    examples: |
      - import_playbook: my_playbook.yml
        vars:
          message: 'Custom debug message'
    return: ~
----
+
See that the play argspec file is very similar to a role argspec file. 
+
.An example of a playbook using a play argspec
[source,yaml]
----
# my_playbook.yml
---
- name: Debug_localhost
  hosts: localhost
  gather_facts: false
  tasks:
    - name: Verify with argspec
      ansible.builtin.validate_argument_spec:
        argument_spec: "{{ (lookup('ansible.builtin.file', filename) | from_yaml)['argument_specs'][lowercase_play_name]['options'] }}"
      vars:
        lowercase_play_name: "{{ ansible_play_name | lower }}"
        filename: "argspec_validation_plays.meta.yml"
    - name: Print debug message
      ansible.builtin.debug:
        msg: "{{ message }}"
----
+
Note that argument validation is the the first task. 

====

== Use either the tasks or roles section in playbooks, not both

[%collapsible]
====
Explanations:: A playbook can contain `pre_tasks`, `roles`, `tasks` and `post_tasks` sections.
Avoid using both `roles` and `tasks` sections, the latter possibly containing `import_role` or `include_role` tasks.
Rationale:: The order of execution between `roles` and `tasks` isn't obvious, and hence mixing them should be avoided.
Examples:: Either you need only static importing of roles and you can use the `roles` section, or you need dynamic inclusion and you should use _only_ the `tasks` section.
Of course, for very simple cases, you can just use `tasks` without `roles`.
====

== Use tags cautiously either for roles or for complete purposes
[%collapsible]
====
Explanations:: limit your usage of tags to two aspects:
+
. either tags called like the roles to switch on/off single roles,
. or specific tags to reach a meaningful purpose

Don't set tags which can't be used on their own, or can be destructive if used on their own.

Also document tags and their purpose(s).

Rationale:: there is nothing worse than tags which can't be used alone, they bear the risk to destroy something by being called standalone.
An acceptable exception is the pattern to use the role name as tag name, which can be useful while developing the playbook to test, or exclude, individual roles.
+
Important is that your users don't need to learn the right sequence of tags necessary to get a meaningful result, one tag should be enough.

Examples::
+
.An example of playbook importing roles with tags
[source,yaml]
----
---
- name: A playbook can be a list of roles imported with tags
  hosts: all
  gather_facts: false
  become: false
  tasks:
    - name: Import role1
      ansible.builtin.import_role:
        name: role1
      tags:
        - role1
        - deploy

    - name: Import role2
      ansible.builtin.import_role:
        name: role2
      tags:
        - role2
        - deploy
        - configure

    - name: Import role3
      ansible.builtin.import_role:
        name: role3
      tags:
        - role3
        - configure
----
+
You see that each role can be skipped/run individually, but also that the tags `deploy` and `configure` can be used to do something we'll assume to be meaningful, without having to explain at length what they do.
+
The same approach is also possible with `include_role` but requires additionally to `apply` the same tags to the role's tasks, which doesn't make the code easier to read:
+
.An example of playbook including roles with tags
[source,yaml]
----
- name: a playbook can be a list of roles included with tags applied
  hosts: all
  gather_facts: false
  become: false

  tasks:
    - name: include role1
      include_role:
        name: role1
        apply:
          tags:
            - role1
            - deploy
      tags:
        - role1
        - deploy
    - name: include role2
      include_role:
        name: role2
        apply:
          tags:
            - role2
            - deploy
            - configure
      tags:
        - role2
        - deploy
        - configure
    - name: include role3
      include_role:
        name: role3
        apply:
          tags:
            - role3
            - configure
      tags:
        - role3
        - configure

====

== Use the verbosity parameter with debug statements
[%collapsible]
====
Explanations:: Debug messages should have a verbosity defined as appropriate for the message.

Rationale::
Debug messages are useful during testing and development, and can be useful to retain as playbooks go into production for future troubleshooting.
However, log messages will clutter your output, which can confuse users with non-relevant information.

Examples::
+
.Adding verbosity to debug messages
[source, yaml]
----
- name: don't make messages always display
  debug:
    msg: "This message will clutter your log in production"

- name: this message will only appear when verbosity is 2 or more
  debug:
    msg: "Some more debug information if needed"
    verbosity: 2
