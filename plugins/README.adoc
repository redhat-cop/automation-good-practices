= Plugins good practices

NOTE: Work in Progress...

== Python Guidelines

* Review Ansible guidelines for https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/dev_guide/developing_modules_best_practices.html[modules] and https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/dev_guide/index.html[development].
* Use https://pep8.org/[PEP8].
* File headers and functions should have comments for their intent.


== Write documentation for all plugin types
[%collapsible]
====
Explanations::
All plugins, regardless of type, need documentation that describes the input parameters, outputs, and practical examples of how to use it.

Examples:: See the Ansible Developer Guide sections on https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/dev_guide/developing_plugins.html#plugin-configuration-documentation-standards[Plugin Configuration and Documentation Standards] and https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/dev_guide/developing_modules_documenting.html#module-documenting[Module Documenting] for more details.
====

== Use sphinx (reST) formatted docstrings in Python code
[%collapsible]
====
Explanations::
Sphinx (reST) formatted docstring are preferred for Ansible development. This includes all parameters, yields, raises, or returns for all classes, private and public functions written in Python.

Rationale::
https://peps.python.org/pep-0257/[PEP-257] states that: "All modules should normally have docstrings, and all functions and classes exported by a module should also have docstrings. Public methods (including the __init__ constructor) should also have docstrings. A package may be documented in the module docstring of the __init__.py file in the package directory."

Examples::
[source,python]
----
"""[Summary]

:param [ParamName]: [ParamDescription], defaults to [DefaultParamVal]
:type [ParamName]: [ParamType](, optional)
...
:raises [ErrorType]: [ErrorDescription]
...
:return: [ReturnDescription]
:rtype: [ReturnType]
"""

== Use Python type hints to document variable types.
[%collapsible]
====
Explanations:: Use Python type hints to document variable types.  Type hints are supported in Python 3.5 and greater.

Rationale::  Type hints communicate what type a variable can be expected to be in the code. They can be consumed by static analysis tools to ensure that variable usage is consistent within the code base.

Examples::
[source,python]
MyPy is a static type checker, which could analyze the following snippet:
----
def greeting(name: str) -> str:
    return 'Hello ' + name
----

====

== The use of unittest is discouraged, use pytest instead.
[%collapsible]
====
Explanations:: Use https://docs.pytest.org/[pytest] for writing unit tests for plugins

Rationale:: Pytest is the testing framework used by Ansible Engineering and will provide the best experience for plugin developers.
The Ansible Developer Guide section on https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/dev_guide/testing_units_modules.html[unit testing] has detailed information on when and how to use unit tests.

Examples::
[source,python]
----
from __future__ import (absolute_import, division, print_function)
__metaclass__ = type

import pytest

from ansible.modules.copy import AnsibleModuleError, split_pre_existing_dir
from ansible.module_utils.basic import AnsibleModule

ONE_DIR_DATA = (('dir1',
                 ('.', ['dir1']),
                 ('dir1', []),
                 ),
                ('dir1/',
                 ('.', ['dir1']),
                 ('dir1', []),
                 ),
                ) 

@pytest.mark.parametrize('directory, expected', ((d[0], d[2]) for d in ONE_DIR_DATA))
def test_split_pre_existing_dir_one_level_exists(directory, expected, mocker):
    mocker.patch('os.path.exists', side_effect=[True, False, False])
    split_pre_existing_dir(directory) == expected

== Formatting of manually maintained plugin argspecs
[%collapsible]
====
Explanations::
Ensure a consistent approach to the way complex argument_specs are formatted within a collection.

Rationale::
When hand-writing a complex argspec, the author may choose to build up to data structure from multiple dictionaries or vars.
Other authors may choose to implement a complex, nested argspec as a single dictionary.
Within a single collection, select one style and use it consistently.

Examples::
Use of a https://github.com/ansible-collections/cisco.nxos/blob/3.0.0/plugins/module_utils/network/nxos/argspec/bgp_global/bgp_global.py[sngle dictionary]

Two different examples of using https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.aws/blob/stable-3/plugins/modules/ec2_scaling_policy.py#L355-L370[multiple] https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.cloud/blob/0.1.0/plugins/modules/backup_report_plan.py#L182-L234[dictionaries].
====


== Keep plugin entry files to a minimal size.
[%collapsible]
====
Explanations::
Keep the entry file to a plugin to a minimal and easily maintainable size.

Rationale::
Long and complex code files can be difficult to maintain.
Move reusable functions and classes, such as those for data validation or manipulation, to a https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/dev_guide/developing_module_utilities.html[module_utils/] (for Ansible modules) or plugin_utils/ (for all other plugin types) file and import them into plugins.
This keeps the Python code easier to read and maintain.
====


== Plugins should be initially developed using the ansible plugin builder
[%collapsible]
====
Explanations::
The https://github.com/ansible-community/ansible.plugin_builder[ansible.plugin_builder] is a tool which helps developers scaffold new plugins.

====


== Use clear error/info messages
[%collapsible]
====
Explanations:: This will make it easier to troubleshoot failures if they occur

Rationale:: Error messages that communicate specific details of the failure will aid in resolving the problem.
Unclear error messages such as "Failed!" are unnecessarily obscure.

Information can be displayed to the user based on the verbosity the task is being executed at.

The base AnsibleModule class from which all modules should be created provides helper methods for reporting warnings and deprecations, and for exiting the module in the case of a failure.

There is a Display class available which enables the display of information at different verbosity levels in all plugin types.

Examples::
[source,python]
----
# Causing a module to exit with a failure status
    if checksum and checksum_src != checksum:
        module.fail_json(
            msg='Copied file does not match the expected checksum. Transfer failed.',
            checksum=checksum_src,
            expected_checksum=checksum
        )


# Displaying a warning during module execution, without exiting
try:
    result = get_kms_metadata_with_backoff(connection, key_id)['KeyMetadata']
    key_id = result['Arn']
except is_boto3_error_code('AccessDeniedException'):
    module.warn('Permission denied fetching key metadata ({0})'.format(key_id))
    return None


# Displaying a notice about a deprecation
if importer_ssl_client_key is None and module.params['client_key'] is not None:
      importer_ssl_client_key = module.params['client_key']
      module.deprecate("In Ansible 2.9.2 `feed_client_key` option was added. Until community.general 3.0.0 the default "
                       "value will come from client_key option",
                       version="3.0.0", collection_name='community.general')


# Display information only when a user has set an increased level of verbosity
# ansible-playbook -i inventory -vvvv test-playbook.yml
from ansible.utils.display import Display

display = Display()

lookupfile = self.find_file_in_search_path(variables, 'files', term)
display.vvvv("File lookup using {0} as file".format(lookupfile))
