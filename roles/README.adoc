= Roles Good Practices for Ansible

NOTE: this section has been imported "as-is" from the https://github.com/oasis-roles/meta_standards[OASIS metastandards repository] and still requires re-formatting to fit the overall structure.

== Background
[%collapsible]
====
The goal of the Ansible Metateam project (specifically, the https://github.com/linux-system-roles[Linux System Roles
project]) is to provide a stable and consistent user
interface to multiple operating systems (multiple versions of RHEL in the downstream RHEL System
Roles package, additionally CentOS, Fedora at least). Stable and consistent means that the same
Ansible playbook will be usable to manage the equivalent functionality in the supported versions
without the administrator (the user of the role) being forced to change anything in the playbook
(the roles should serve as abstractions to shield the administrator from differences). Of course,
this means that the interface of the roles should be itself stable (i.e. changing only in a backward
compatible way). This implies a great responsibility in the design of the interface, because the
interface, unlike the underlying implementation, can not be easily changed.

The differences in the underlying operating systems that the roles need to compensate for are
basically of two types:

* Trivial differences like changed names of packages, services, changed location of configuration
files. Roles must deals with those by using internal variables based on the OS defaults. This is
fairly simple, but still it brings value to the user, because they then do not have to worry about
keeping up with such trivial changes.
* Change of the underlying implementation of a given functionality. Quite often, there are multiple
packages/components implementing the same functionality. Classic examples are the various MTAs
(sendmail, postfix, qmail, exim), FTP daemons, etc. In the context of Linux System Roles, we call
them "`providers`". The goal of the roles is to abstract even such differences, so that when the OS
changes to a different component (provider), the role continues to work. An example is time
synchronization, where RHEL used to use the ntpd package, then chrony was introduced and became
the default, but both components have been shipped in RHEL 6 and RHEL 7, until finally ntpd was
dropped from RHEL 8, leaving only chrony. A role covering time synchronization should therefore
support both components with the same interface, and on systems which ship both components, both
should be supported. The appropriate supported component should be automatically selected on
systems that ship only one of them. This covers several related use cases:
 ** Users that want to manage multiple major releases of the system simultaneously with a single playbook.
 ** Users that want to migrate to a new version of the system without changing their automation (playbook).
 ** Users who want to switch to a different provider in the same version of the OS (like switching
from ntpd to chrony to RHEL 7) and keep the same playbook.

Designing the interface in the latter case is difficult because it has to be sufficiently abstract
to cover different providers. We, for example, do not provide an email role in the Linux System
Roles project, only a postfix role, because the underlying implementations (sendmail, postfix) were
deemed to be too divergent. Generally, an abstract interface should be something that should be
always aimed for though, especially if there are multiple providers in use already, and in
particular when the default provider is changing or is known to be likely to change in the next
major releases.

== Basics
[%collapsible]
====
* Every repository in the AGP-roles namespace should be a valid Ansible Galaxy compatible role
with the exception of any whose names begin with "meta_", such as this one.
* New roles should be initiated in line with the skeleton directory, which has standard boilerplate
code for a Galaxy-compatible Ansible role and some enforcement around these standards
* Use https://semver.org/[semantic versioning] for Git release tags.  Use
0.y.z before the role is declared stable (interface-wise).  Although it has
not been a problem so far for linux system roles, since they use strict X.Y.Z
versioning, you should be aware that there are some
https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/67512[restrictions] for Ansible
Galaxy and Automation Hub.  The versioning must be in strict X.Y.Z[ab][W]
format, where X, Y, and Z are integers.
====

== Interface design considerations

What should a role do and how can a user tell it what to do.

=== Basic design
[%collapsible]
====
Try to design the interface focused on the functionality, not on the software implementation behind
it. This will help abstracting differences between different providers (see above), and help the
user to focus on the functionality, not on technical details.
====

=== Naming things
[%collapsible]
====
* All defaults and all arguments to a role should have a name that begins with the role name to help
avoid collision with other names. Avoid names like `packages` in favor of a name like `foo_packages`.
(Rationale: Ansible has no namespaces, doing so reduces the potential for conflicts and makes
clear what role a given variable belongs to.)
* Same argument applies for modules provided in the roles, they also need a `$ROLENAME_` prefix:
`foo_module`. While they are usually implementation details and not intended for direct use in
playbooks, the unfortunate fact is that importing a role makes them available to the rest of the
playbook and therefore creates opportunities for name collisions.
* Moreover, internal variables (those that are not expected to be set by users) are to be prefixed
by two underscores: `__foo_variable`. (Rationale: role variables, registered variables, custom
facts are usually intended to be local to the role, but in reality are not local to the role - as
such a concept does not exist, and pollute the global namespace. Using the name of the role
reduces the potential for name conflicts and using the underscores clearly marks the variables as
internals and not part of the common interface. The two underscores convention has prior art in
some popular roles like
https://github.com/geerlingguy/ansible-role-apache/blob/f2b91ac84001db3fd4b43306a8f73f1a54f96f7d/vars/Debian.yml#L8[geerlingguy.ansible-role-apache]). This
includes variables set by set_fact and register, because they persist in the namespace after the
role has finished!
* Prefix all tags within a role with the role name or, alternatively, a "unique enough" but descriptive prefix.
====

=== Providers
[%collapsible]
====
When there are multiple implementations of the same functionality, we call them "`providers`". A role
supporting multiple providers should have an input variable called `$ROLENAME_provider`. If this
variable is not defined, the role should detect the currently running provider on the system, and
respect it. (Rationale: users can be surprised if the role changes the provider if they are running
one already.) If there is no provider currently running, the role should select one according to the
OS version. (E.g. on RHEL 7, chrony should be selected as the provider of time synchronization,
unless there is ntpd already running on the system, or user requests it specifically. Chrony should
be chosen on RHEL 8 as well, because it is the only provider available.) The role should set a
variable or custom fact called `$ROLENAME_provider_os_default` to the appropriate default value for
the given OS version. (Rationale: users may want to set all their managed systems to a consistent
state, regardless of the provider that has been used previously. Setting `$ROLENAME_provider` would
achieve it, but is suboptimal, because it requires selecting the appropriate value by the user, and
if the user has multiple system versions managed by a single playbook, a common value supported by
all of them may not even exist. Moreover, after a major upgrade of their systems, it may force the
users to change their playbooks to change their `$ROLENAME_provider` setting, if the previous value
is not supported anymore. Exporting `$ROLENAME_provider_os_default` allows the users to set
`$ROLENAME_provider: "{{ $ROLENAME_provider_os_default }}"` (thanks to the lazy variable evaluation
in Ansible) and thus get a consistent setting for all the systems of the given OS version without
having to decide what the actual value is - the decision is delegated to the role.)
====

== Implementation considerations

=== Role Structure
[%collapsible]
====
Avoid testing for distribution and version in tasks. Rather add a variable file to "vars/"
for each supported distribution and version with the variables that need to change according
to the distribution and version. This way it is easy to add support to a new distribution by
simply dropping a new file in to "vars/", see below
<<supporting-multiple-distributions-and-versions,Supporting multiple distributions and versions>>. See also
<<vars-vs-defaults,Vars vs Defaults>> which mandates "Avoid embedding large lists or 'magic values' directly
into the playbook." Since distribution-specific values are kind of "magic values", it applies to them. The
same logic applies for providers: a role can load a provider-specific variable file, include a
provider-specific task file, or both, as needed. Consider making paths to templates internal variables if you
need different templates for different distributions.
====

=== Check Mode and Idempotency Issues
[%collapsible]
====
* The role should work in check mode, meaning that first of all, they should not fail check mode, and
they should also not report changes when there are no changes to be done. If it is not possible
to support it, please state the fact and provide justification in the documentation.
This applies to the first run of the role.
* Reporting changes properly is related to the other requirement: *idempotency*. Roles
should not perform changes when applied a second time to the same system with the same parameters,
and it should not report that changes have been done if they have not been done. Due to this,
using `command:` is problematic, as it always reports changes. Therefore, override the result by
using `changed_when:`
* Concerning check mode, one usual obstacle to supporting it are registered variables. If there
is a task which registers a variable and this task does not get executed (e.g. because it is a
`command:` or another task which is not properly idempotent), the variable will not get registered
and further accesses to it will fail (or worse, use the previous value, if the role has been
applied before in the play, because variables are global and there is no way to unregister them).
To fix, either use a properly idempotent module to obtain the information (e.g. instead of
using `command: cat` to read file into a registered variable, use `slurp` and apply `.content|b64decode`
to the result like
https://github.com/linux-system-roles/kdump/pull/23/files#diff-d2414d4ec8ba189e1a244b0afc9aa81eL8[here]),
or apply proper `check_mode:` and `changed_when:` attributes to the task.
https://github.com/ansible/molecule/issues/128#issue-135906202[more_info].
* Another problem are commands that you need to execute to make changes. In check mode, you
need to test for changes without actually applying them. If the command has some kind of "--dry-run"
flag to enable executing without making actual changes, use it in check_mode (use the variable
`ansible_check_mode` to determine whether we are in check mode). But you then need to set `changed_when:`
according to the command status or output to indicate changes. See
(https://github.com/linux-system-roles/selinux/pull/38/files#diff-2444ad0870f91f17ca6c2a5e96b26823L101) for
an example.
* Another problem is using commands that get installed during the install phase, which is
skipped in check mode. This will make check mode fail if the role has not been executed
before (and the packages are not there), but does the right thing if check mode is executed after
normal mode.
* To view reasoning for supporting why check mode in first execution may not be worthwhile: see
https://github.com/ansible/molecule/issues/128#issuecomment-245009843[here]. If this is to be supported,
see hhaniel's proposal
https://github.com/linux-system-roles/timesync/issues/27#issuecomment-472466223[here], which seems to
properly guard even against such cases.

=== Supporting multiple distributions and versions

==== Platform specific variables
[%collapsible]
====
You normally use `vars/main.yml` (automatically included) to set variables
used by your role.  If some variables need to be parameterized according to
distribution and version (name of packages, configuration file paths, names of
services), use this in the beginning of your `tasks/main.yml`:

[source,yaml]
----
- name: Set platform/version specific variables
  include_vars: "{{ __rolename_vars_file }}"
  loop:
    - "{{ ansible_facts['os_family'] }}.yml"
    - "{{ ansible_facts['distribution'] }}.yml"
    - "{{ ansible_facts['distribution'] }}_{{ ansible_facts['distribution_major_version'] }}.yml"
    - "{{ ansible_facts['distribution'] }}_{{ ansible_facts['distribution_version'] }}.yml"
  vars:
    __rolename_vars_file: "{{ role_path }}/vars/{{ item }}"
  when: __rolename_vars_file is file
----

The files in the `loop` are in order from least specific to most specific:

* `os_family` covers a group of closely related platforms (e.g. `RedHat`
covers RHEL, CentOS, Fedora)
* `distribution` (e.g. `Fedora`) is more specific than `os_family`
* ``distribution``_``distribution_major_version`` (e.g. `RedHat_8`) is more
specific than `distribution`
* ``distribution``_``distribution_version`` (e.g. `RedHat_8.3`) is the most
specific

See https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_conditionals.html#ansible-facts-distribution[Commonly Used
Facts]
for an explanation of the facts and their common values.

Each file in the `loop` list will allow you to add or override variables to
specialize the values for platform and/or version.  Using the `when: item is
file` test means that you do not have to provide all of the `vars/` files,
only the ones you need.  For example, if every platform except Fedora uses
`srv_name` for the service name, you can define `myrole_service: srv_name` in
`vars/main.yml` then define `myrole_service: srv2_name` in `vars/Fedora.yml`.
In cases where this would lead to duplicate vars files for similar
distributions (e.g. CentOS 7 and RHEL 7), use symlinks to avoid the
duplication.

*NOTE*: With this setup, files can be loaded twice.  For example, on Fedora,
the `distribution_major_version` is the same as `distribution_version` so the
file `vars/Fedora_31.yml` will be loaded twice if you are managing a Fedora 31
host.  If `distribution` is `RedHat` then `os_family` will also be `RedHat`,
and `vars/RedHat.yml` will be loaded twice. This is usually not a problem -
you will be replacing the variable with the same value, and the performance
hit is negligible.  If this is a problem, construct the file list as a list
variable, and filter the variable passed to `loop` using the `unique` filter
(which preserves the order):

[source,yaml]
----
- name: Set vars file list
  set_fact:
    __rolename_vars_file_list:
      - "{{ ansible_facts['os_family'] }}.yml"
      - "{{ ansible_facts['distribution'] }}.yml"
      - "{{ ansible_facts['distribution'] }}_{{ ansible_facts['distribution_major_version'] }}.yml"
      - "{{ ansible_facts['distribution'] }}_{{ ansible_facts['distribution_version'] }}.yml"

- name: Set platform/version specific variables
  include_vars: "{{ __rolename_vars_file }}"
  loop: "{{ __rolename_vars_file_list | unique | list }}"
  vars:
    __rolename_vars_file: "{{ role_path }}/vars/{{ item }}"
  when: __rolename_vars_file is file
----

Or define your `__rolename_vars_file_list` in your `vars/main.yml`.
====

==== Platform specific tasks
[%collapsible]
====
Platform specific tasks, however, are different.  You probably want to perform
platform specific tasks once, for the most specific match.  In that case, use
`lookup('first_found')` with the file list in order of most specific to least
specific, including a "default":

[source,yaml]
----
- name: Perform platform/version specific tasks
  include_tasks: "{{ lookup('first_found', __rolename_ff_params) }}"
  vars:
    __rolename_ff_params:
      files:
        - "{{ ansible_facts['distribution'] }}_{{ ansible_facts['distribution_version'] }}.yml"
        - "{{ ansible_facts['distribution'] }}_{{ ansible_facts['distribution_major_version'] }}.yml"
        - "{{ ansible_facts['distribution'] }}.yml"
        - "{{ ansible_facts['os_family'] }}.yml"
        - "default.yml"
      paths:
        - "{{ role_path }}/tasks/setup"
----

Then you would provide `tasks/setup/default.yml` to do the generic setup, and
e.g. `tasks/setup/Fedora.yml` to do the Fedora specific setup.  The
`tasks/setup/default.yml` is required in order to use `lookup('first_found')`,
which will give an error if no file is found.

If you want to have the "use first file found" semantics, but do not want to
have to provide a default file, add `skip: true`:

[source,yaml]
----
- name: Perform platform/version specific tasks
  include_tasks: "{{ lookup('first_found', __rolename_ff_params) }}"
  vars:
    __rolename_ff_params:
      files:
        - "{{ ansible_facts['distribution'] }}_{{ ansible_facts['distribution_version'] }}.yml"
        - "{{ ansible_facts['os_family'] }}.yml"
      paths:
        - "{{ role_path }}/tasks/setup"
      skip: true
----

*NOTE*:

* Use `include_tasks` or `include_vars` with `lookup('first_found')` instead
of `with_first_found`.  `loop` is not needed - the include forms take a
string or a list directly.
* Always specify the explicit, absolute path to the files to be included,
using `{{ role_path }}/vars` or `{{ role_path }}/tasks`, when using these
idioms. See below "Ansible Best Practices" for more information.
* Use the `ansible_facts['name']` bracket notation rather than the
`ansible_facts.name` or `ansible_name` form.  For example, use
`ansible_facts['distribution']` instead of `ansible_distribution` or
`ansible.distribution`.  The `ansible_name` form relies on fact injection,
which can break if there is already a fact of that name. Also, the bracket
notation is what is used in Ansible documentation such as https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_conditionals.html#ansible-facts-distribution[Commonly Used
Facts]
and https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_best_practices.html#operating-system-and-distribution-variance[Operating System and Distribution
Variance]
====

=== Supporting multiple providers
[%collapsible]
====
Use a task file per provider and include it from the main task file, like this example from `storage:`

[source,yaml]
----
- name: include the appropriate provider tasks
  include_tasks: "main_{{ storage_provider }}.yml"
----

The same process should be used for variables (not defaults, as defaults can
not be loaded according to a variable).  You should guarantee that a file
exists for each provider supported, or use an explicit, absolute path using
`role_path`.  See below "Ansible Best Practices" for more information.
====

=== Generating files from templates
[%collapsible]
====
* Add ``{{ ansible_managed | comment }}`` at the top of the template file file to indicate that the file is managed by Ansible roles, while making sure that multi-line values are properly commented.
For more information, see https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_filters.html#adding-comments-to-files[Adding comments to files].
* When commenting, don't include anything like "Last modified: {{ date }}". This would change the file at
every application of the role, even if it doesn't need to be changed for other reasons, and thus break
proper change reporting.
* Use standard module parameters for backups, keep it on unconditionally (`backup: true`). (Until there is a
user request to have it configurable.)
* Make prominently clear in the HOWTO (at the top) what settings/configuration files are replaced by the role
instead of just modified.
+
* Use `{{ role_path }}/subdir/` as the filename prefix when including files if the name has a variable in it.
+

Rationale:: your role may be included by another role, and if you specify a relative path, the file could be found in the including role.
For example, if you have something like `include_vars: "{{ ansible_facts['distribution'] }}.yml"` and you do not provide every possible `vars/{{ ansible_facts['distribution'] }}.yml` in your role, Ansible will look in the including role for this file.
Instead, to ensure that only your role will be referenced, use `include_vars: "{{role_path}}/vars/{{ ansible_facts['distribution'] }}.yml"`.
Same with other file based includes such as `include_tasks`.
See https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/dev_guide/overview_architecture.html#the-ansible-search-path[Ansible Developer Guide » Ansible architecture » The Ansible Search Path] for more information.
====

==== Vars vs Defaults
[%collapsible]
====
* Avoid embedding large lists or "magic values" directly into the playbook. Such static lists should be
placed into the `vars/main.yml` file and named appropriately
* Every argument accepted from outside of the role should be given a default value in `defaults/main.yml`.
This allows a single place for users to look to see what inputs are expected. Document these variables
in the role's README.md file copiously
* Use the `defaults/main.yml` file in order to avoid use of the default Jinja2 filter within a playbook.
Using the default filter is fine for optional keys on a dictionary, but the variable itself should be
defined in `defaults/main.yml` so that it can have documentation written about it there and so that all
arguments can easily be located and identified.
* Avoid giving default values in `vars/main.yml` as such values are very high in the precedence order and
are difficult for users and consumers of a role to override.
* As an example, if a role requires a large number of packages to install, but could also accept a list of
additional packages, then the required packages should be placed in `vars/main.yml` with a name such as
`foo_packages`, and the extra packages should be passed in a variable named `foo_extra_packages`,
which should default to an empty array in `defaults/main.yml` and be documented as such.
====

=== Documentation conventions
[%collapsible]
====
* Use fully qualified role names in examples, like: `linux-system-roles.$ROLENAME` (with
the Galaxy prefix).
* Use RFC https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5737[5737],
https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7042#section-2.1.1[7042] and
https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3849[3849] addresses in examples.
* Modules should have complete metadata, documentation, example and return blocks as
described in the
https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/dev_guide/developing_modules_documenting.html[Ansible docs].
====

=== Don't use host group names or at least make them a parameter
[%collapsible]
====
Explanations::
It is relatively common to use (inventory) group names in roles:
+
* either to loop through the hosts in the group, generally in a cluster context
* or to validate that a host is in a specific group
+
Instead, store the host name(s) in a (list) variable, or at least make the group name a parameter of your role.
You can always set the variable at group level to avoid repetitions.

Rationale::
Groups are a feature of the data in your inventory, meaning that you mingle data with code when you use those groups in your code.
Rely on the inventory-parsing process to provide your code with the variables it needs instead of enforcing a specific structure of the inventory.
Not all inventory sources are flexible enough to provide exactly the expected group name.
Even more importantly, in a cluster context for example, if the group name is fixed, you can't describe (and hence automate) more than one cluster in each inventory.
You can't possibly have multiple groups with the same name in the same inventory.
On the other hand, variables can have any kind of value for each host, so that you can have as many clusters as you want.

Examples::
Assuming we have the following inventory (not according to recommended practices for sake of simplicity):
+
.An inventory with two clusters
[source,ini]
----
include::dont_use_groups/inventory[]
----
+
We can then use one of the following three approaches in our role (here as playbook, again for sake of simplicity):
+
.A playbook showing how to loop through a group
[source,yaml]
----
include::dont_use_groups/playbook.yml[]
----
+
The first approach is probably best to create a cluster configuration file listing all cluster's hosts.
The other approaches are good to make sure each action is performed only once, but this comes at the price of many skips.
The second one fails if the first host isn't reachable (which might be what you'd want anyway), and the last one has the best chance to be executed once and only once, even if some hosts aren't available.
+
TIP: the variable `cluster_group_name` could have a default group name value in your role, of course properly documented, for simple use cases.
+
Overall, it is best to avoid this kind of constructs if the use case permits, as they are clumsy.
