Before you suggest _automation_ guidelines, please consider the _contribution_ guidelines layed out in this document.

toc::[]

== Writing

. The guidelines are written in https://asciidoctor.org[asciidoc as described by Asciidoctor].
. each guideline is made of one sentence, as easy to remember as possible, followed by a collapsible description, made of:
** explanations
** rationale
** examples
+
The result looks then as the following template shows (you may copy & paste):
+
[source,asciidoc]
------------------------------------------------------------------------
.[big]#**Do this and do not do that is the guideline**#
[%collapsible]
====
Explanations:: These are explanations

Rationale:: This is the rationale

Examples:: These are examples
+
.A mini playbook example
[source,yaml]
----
- name: a mini example of playbook
  hosts: all
  gather_facts: false
  become: false

  tasks:

  - name: say what we all think
    debug:
      msg: asciidoctor is {{ my_private_thoughts }}
----

Even more examples...
====
------------------------------------------------------------------------
// maintain the code above in sync with the example below
+
NOTE: see how it looks like in the <<_example>> section below.
+
. Those guidelines are grouped into sections and optionally sub-sections, as far as required for maintainability.
. Those (sub-)sections can be written in their own source file, but then are included with `include::directory/file.adoc[leveloffset=1]` in the parent section's file.
  This makes sure that all source files are interlinked and can be rendered all together by rendering the top `README.adoc`, either with `asciidoctor` or with `asciidoctor-pdf`.
+
NOTE: this contribution file is obviously not meant for inclusion in the overall document.
+
. Each source file has a single title (the line starting with one equal sign) and can be rendered individually (the `leveloffset` is set such that it fits in the overall headings structure when included).
. The source code is written as readable as possible in its raw form, without impacting maintainability.
. We follow the https://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-recommended-practices/[Asciidoc recommended practices].
. Sentences are written in the present tense form, avoid "should", "must", etc.
  For example, "Sentences are written", not "Sentences should be written" or "Sentences must be written". This avoids filler words.
. The https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_they[singular "they"] is used to avoid the unreadable "he/she/it" construct and still be neutral.

== Contributing

. Just fork the repository, create a Pull Request (PR) and offer your changes.
. Feel free to review existing PR and give your opinion
. Also an issue against one of the recommendations is a valid approach

== Example

This is how one guideline as shown above looks like once rendered:

// This is a duplicate from the above code, but rendered e.g. by GitHub, it shows how it's supposed to look like.
